# 💳 Analyzing Customer Insights for Mitron Bank

I recently worked on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project for Mitron Bank, where I analyzed customer spending trends to support their new credit card launch strategy.

## 🏦Problem Statement:
Mitron Bank is exploring the launch of a new line of credit cards, and AtliQ Data Services took on the challenge to analyze customer behavior and spending trends from a sample dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities.<br>

## 🔧Tool Used:
Python

## 🔍Key Insights:
➡️Males constitute 64.9% of the customer base, while females account for 35.1%, indicating a strong male dominance. <br>
➡️Salaried IT employees form the largest customer segment (32.4%), followed by other salaried employees (22.3%) and freelancers (19.6%). Business owners (15.8%) and government employees (10.0%) contribute less, suggesting an opportunity to expand engagement in these sectors through tailored marketing strategies.<br>
➡️The 25-34 age group has the highest total spending, followed closely by the 35-45 age group, indicating strong purchasing power in these segments.<br>
➡️People in Mumbai and Delhi NCR spend the most, while Chennai and Hyderabad have lower spending despite similar incomes.<br>
➡️Mumbai has the highest total spend, followed by Delhi NCR and Bengaluru. Chennai and Hyderabad have comparatively lower spending. This indicates Mumbai as the most significant market for spending.<br>
